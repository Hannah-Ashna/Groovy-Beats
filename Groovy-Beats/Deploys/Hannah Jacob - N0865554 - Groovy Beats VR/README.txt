Welcome to Groovy Beats VR!

[Get the Latest Version]
If you'd like the latest version of the .APK you can head to: https://hannah-ashna.github.io/Groovy-Beats/

[SideQuest Setup]
The Installation-Guide.pdf should guide you through getting the .APK onto your headset using SideQuest.

[Using Batch and ADB]
The .BAT (Batch) install and uninstall files can be used to get the .APK onto your headset without SideQuest but are subject to you having ADB set up onto your device (PC/Laptop). If you've got ADB working then you're all good to just double click the install .BAT file and let it run! Once it's done and closes the command prompt window, Groovy Beats should now be available on your headset via 'Unknown Sources' in your App library.
