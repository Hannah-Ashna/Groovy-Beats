# Groovy Beats VR
What started out as a University VR project, Groovy Beats explores the capabilities of VR through a mini simulated experience set in a tech society's social space. However, when an oversight triggers a series of mishaps perhaps there's more to this casual simulation ...

### About:
Groovy Beats was made as part of my final year VR module and is a testament to all the different VR developments skills for Unreal Engine that I've picked up over the course of the academic year. The game is set in a 'simulation' or the Developer's Society room. The storyline however, continues far beyond those physical limits (no spoilers!).
